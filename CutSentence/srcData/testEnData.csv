The pandemic is currently seeing a great many hospitals which are nearly empty.
Instead of coronavirus patients, Syracuse hospitals swamped with empty beds
Mainly because “elective surgery” usage is basically zero.
Locally, hospitals are reducing hours for nurses. More nurses are idle here than are being “burned out.”
Coronavirus: Volusia/Flagler/St. Johns hospital bed usage is low
Thus, it is highly unlikely that the US will have any nurse shortage due to burnout."

Doctors to survive and not fail with suicide or depression or drug addiction must maintain better boundaries to keep home and love and family and hobbies and their spirituality intact.

Frankly if governments could sort their Medicare systems and extend funding for allied health programs, decriminalise and legalise cannabis safely, regulate opioids properly and reign in health insurance companies and the monopoly they have in certain sectors, thus instigating safe ratios for nurses to patients then maybe people would be better and healthier therefore reducing the strain on the system as a whole from birth to death.

In my experience, the “ corporatization” of medicine has meant treating patients as “customers” demanding “service” rather than appropriate, thoughtful care, and the pressure to “ produce” by seeing an ever increasing number of patients per day, resulting in less time to spend listening, being thorough with diagnosis, and having time to explain treatment options & do patient education. It’s hard not to feel burned out when you’re being expected to practice “assembly line” medicine."

Of course there would be kinks to work out, and it's a pipe dream from where we stand today. But the point is that the problem isn't with individual doctors, per se. It's with the system they work in. Some only go into it for the glory and the paycheck. And those who go into it with good intentions get burned out because they don't have enough time with patients, they have to make decisions based off of insurance and financial reasons rather than what might actually solve the problems and heal their patients, they're inundated with drug companies trying to take them to lunch and woo them to push more pills on patients instead of looking for how to help them actually get better, they're too segmented as far as western medicine versus eastern medicine versus homeopathy, etc., so they don't have a well rounded set of tools to heal with, but instead a pad of paper that allows them to write proscription prescriptions mostly, and they see so many people without really getting a chance to look further and try to help them that their compassion just wilts away. It is very sad and I'm sure many of them really do want to help, but we aren't giving them the opportunity to do so.

I think the larger question this data presents is what are the core stresses of doctors overall.
The larger question is why isn’t the emergency medicine higher on the list. I’m curious if this points to the fact that people self-select and that you eventually adjust to certain stresses in the work environment.
Urology is actually pretty low on the list, in the lower 25% of the feelings of stress.
